In this workshop, I learned several things: how to structure code and deal with modules, how to write namespacing in modules, how to split functions into separate modules for structuring them more effectively, and including only the required header files in other modules. It came to my mind that including files randomly can lead to excessive usage of memory, which is against efficiency. Working with Matrix to upload and test my program was a new experience, quite challenging as well. The first time, I did have some problems, but afterwards, ChatGPT helped me understand how to upload my files correctly. Another thing that was new was the concept of safeguards in header files. Interesting to see how they can prevent errors like including the same file multiple times. In all, this workshop gave me many practical skills for improving my coding and project organization.
