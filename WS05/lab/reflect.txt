at first it was a hard workshop for me, the type operators was very challenging for me and still it is... the last questions which was helper function and += operators was easier for me.. so i have to do some more practice on type conversion operators.
it took me an hour to figure out what is exactly the bool() operator, it seems very easy but understanding it was hard for me.
